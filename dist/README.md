# Iterable Transforms

https://github.com/kahmannf/iterable-transforms#readme

Typescript/Javascript library for manipulation of Iterables. Inspiered by the C#-Linq API

Available transformations:

- concat
- count
- distinct
- filter
- first
- flat
- groupBy
- last
- map
- reduce
- reverse
- skip
- skipWhile
- sort
- thenSort
- take
- takeWhile

There is a function for each operator/tranformation. In addition to that there is the `IterableTransform` class available for easy chaining of these operators. The signature of the class-Methods are the same, with an exception to the source-Parameter.
